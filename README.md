# Peaked-circuits
    Over a decade after its original proposal, the idea of using quantum computers to ''sample quantum mechanics'' has stood as a pivotal pathway to quantum advantage demonstrations. Yet a severe drawback remains: Its verification requires exponential classical computation. As an attempt to overcome this difficulty, we propose a new candidate for quantum advantage experiments with ''peaked circuits'', i.e., quantum circuits with high concentrations on a computational basis. Naturally, this heaviest output string can be used for classical verification. 
    In this work, we analytically and numerically study an explicit construction of peaked circuits by attaching random quantum circuits (RQCs) with parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs). If the trend in our result persists, at system size n = 50 and circuit depth n, we would be able to generate an average peak weight of 0.05% by attaching a highly scrambled circuit, whose gate count is half of the RQC, to the RQC layers. This means the peaked circuits we found could serve as a potential candidate for future verifiable quantum advantage experiments.
