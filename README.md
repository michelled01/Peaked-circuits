# Peaked-boson-sampling



---
The use of randomness in quantum circuits is an intrinsically interesting property due to the model's convergence to the hard-to-simulate Haar measure. While random circuit sampling is both promising for quantum advantage and realistically implementable on a NISQ device, it is not yet efficiently verifiable. Previous work in studying peaked random circuit sampling models has shown optimism for a potentially viable model [[1]](#1). In this paper, we extend those observations by studying a simpler, alternative model to quantum computation involving beamsplitter networks. We present numerical and theoretical findings on the structure of peaked beamsplitter networks and evaluate their potential as a candidate for quantum advantage experiments.
